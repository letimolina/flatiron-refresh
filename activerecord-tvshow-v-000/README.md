## Objectives

1. Create a table using ActiveRecord
2. Use Active Record's querying methods.


## Overview

In this lab, we'll be working in a TV show domain. We have a TV Show model, the `Show` class, and a shows table that you'll create in your database. 

You'll be required not only to write a migration that creates a shows table and gives the `Show` class certain attributes, but also to use Active Record's querying methods. 

### Active Record Querying Methods

Active Record makes it easy to ask our database for certain information and datasets by providing a bunch of built-in methods for us to use to do just that. For example, we can request the sum of all of the values of a particular column with the `#sum` method like this:

```ruby
<class name>.sum(:<column_name>)
```

We can query our database based on certain conditions using the `#where` method. 

Let's say we have a `Song` class and table and each song has rating, `number_of_stars` attribute. We could query for songs with more than 3 stars like this:

```ruby
Song.where("number_of_starts > ?", 3)
```

Let's look at one more example: Let's say we wanted to query our database for the lowest value in the `number_of_stars` column, i.e. the lowest rating that any song has:

```ruby
Song.minimum(:number_of_stars)
```

You'll be writing methods that *rely on Active Record methods like `#minimum`, `#sum` and `#where`* to get these tests passing. 

Use the following resources to help you find the Active Record query methods that will help you pass these tests:

* [Calcuations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#calculations)
* [Ordering](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#ordering)
* [Conditions](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#conditions)

## Instructions

### Migration

* Create a file in the `db/migrate` folder called `001_create_shows.rb`. In this file, write the migration code to create a shows table. The table should have name, network, day, network and rating columns. Name, network and day have a datatype of string and rating has a datatype of integer. 
* Create a file, `show.rb`, in `app/models`. In this file you will define a `Show` class that inherits from Active Record Base. 
* Now we need to create a second migration to add another column to our shows table. In the `db/migrate` folder, create another file, `002_add_season_to_shows.rb` and write a migration to add a column, season, to the shows table. The datatype of this column is string.  

### Methods

You'll be defining the following methods:

* `#highest_rating`: this method should return the highest value in the ratings column. *hint:* if there is a `#minimum` Active Record method, might there be a `#maximum` method?
* `#most_popular_show`: this method should return the show with the highest rating. *hint:* use the `#highest_rating` method as a helper method. 
* `#lowest_rating`: returns the lowest value in the ratings column. 
* `#least_popular_show`: returns the show with the lowest rating. 
* `#ratings_sum`: returns the sum of all of the ratings. 
* `#popular_shows`: returns an array of all of the shows that have a rating greater than `5`. *hint:* use the `#where` method Active Record method. 
* `#shows_by_alphabetical_order`: returns an array of all of the shows sorted by alphabetical order according to their names. *hint:* use the `#order` Active Record method.

# Flatiron Refresh

## Why am I doing this?
After I graduated Flatiron School, I didn't really do much coding over the next five months for a variety of personal reasons. So now I am going through the Ruby and Rails labs again to shake off the cobwebs and wake up all the things I learned (and taking better notes in the process).
